<h2>Explanation of AJAX</h2>

<p>
  This page uses an AJAX request to load the CD catalog from an external XML file.
  When the user clicks the “Get CD catalog” button above, the JavaScript function
  <code>loadDoc()</code> runs. Inside that function, the browser creates a new
  <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object, which is the tool that handles AJAX calls.
  The <code>xhttp.open("GET", "cd_catalog.xml")</code> line prepares the request by
  telling the browser which file to load, and the <code>xhttp.send()</code> line
  actually sends the request.
</p>

<p>
  When the XML file finishes loading, the <code>onload</code> function runs and
  passes the response into <code>myFunction()</code>. This function reads the
  XML response using <code>responseXML</code>, loops through each
  <code>&lt;CD&gt;</code> element, and extracts the artist and title. It then
  builds an HTML table and inserts it into the page using
  <code>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML</code>. This is how the CD
  catalog is displayed on the page without needing to refresh the whole webpage.
</p>

<h2>REST API</h2>

<p>
  For my REST API report, I chose the Countries and Cities API, which gives access
  to geographic and demographic data from places all around the world. I could
  see this being really useful for any project involving travel tools, cultural
  info, global data dashboards, or anything that needs up-to-date country and
  city information without building a huge database from scratch.
</p>

<p>
  One thing I appreciate about this API is that everything comes back in JSON.
  It keeps the data lightweight and easy to work with, especially when you're
  using JavaScript. Since the information is already organized in simple
  key–value pairs, it doesn’t take much effort to pull out what you need and
  display it in dropdown menus, search results, or anything else on a webpage.
</p>

<p>
  Another big plus is that the API doesn’t require an API key at all. You can
  just start testing and making requests right away, which makes it super
  convenient for students, smaller teams, or anyone working on a quick
  prototype. There are no fees, no rate limits you have to plan around, and
  nothing to sign up for. It makes the whole process more accessible while still
  giving you a good amount of global data to work with.
</p>

<p>
  The documentation is also very straightforward. It walks you through each
  endpoint with examples and sample JSON responses, so it’s pretty easy to
  figure out how everything works. If you want to check it out, the
  <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52">Countries and Cities API documentation</a>
  explains how to get a full list of countries, pull all the cities for a given
  country, and explore the other geographic details it offers.
